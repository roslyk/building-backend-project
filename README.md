## A Small Project on Admin Sections on a Website

This is a project which focuses on creating the backend for an application, making sure that the admin can create, edit and delete posts. In this project we also see that there are now 3 types of middleware, one for the admin, another for autenticated users and a third for guests. In order to pretend that you are admin, register a user with username "chrisser". Having that username gives you all the capabilities of the admin.
